( OS ) -used to get information about a computer's operating system. e.g) os.userInfo() os.uptime() os.type(), os.release() os.totalmem(), os.freemem()

( PATH )- provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
path.join() joins paths using the seperator
path.base() get the file at the end of the file path
path.set(seperator /)
path.resolve(\_\_dirname, content, subfolder, test.text) => returns the absolute path

FS (FILESYSTEM) - contains all the functions you need to read, write, and delete files on the local machine.
async and sync
fs.readFileSync(path to specific file, encoding(utf8)) [reads the file and return its content]

fs.writeFileSync(path, value you want to write) write data in files, synchronous (code blocking)
if the file doesn't exist node will create the new value
if it does exist ndoe will override the values in that file
, if you use {flag:"a"} the value will be appended isntead of overriding

async way

method requires callback

realFile("path", callback(err, result )=>{})

writeFile()

HTTP - allows Node. js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
